## Setting up the Project

Make sure that you have localDB up and running. For development, this project uses localDB. If you are having issues installing local DB, [see here.](https://www.sqlshack.com/install-microsoft-sql-server-express-localdb/)

Alterntively, you could also setup an instance of SQLExpress or you can use a full installation of SQL Server. Just note that if you do any of these alternatives, you'll have to change the connection string.

If you have any issues setting up a local instance of a DB, feel free to reach out to me (Robert).
